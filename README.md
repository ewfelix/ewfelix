- 👋 Hi, I’m @ewfelix
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning methods for computational physics and developing/working on software
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning, data structures and algothims, and ai
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computational physics projects, e.g. fluid dynamics, markov chains for statsitical mechanics problems. Most recently I am working on a game with a couple of friends. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Contact me @ erickwfelix@gmail.com
